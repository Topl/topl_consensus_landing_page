# topl_consensus_landing_page

A static landing page for the Topl Consensus event. The main CTA for the page is to collect applications for the grant program as well as push people towards our Discord. Please note - the 5 day time constaints of the project meant that even though mobile responsiveness has been added, cross broswer testing was not completed, so there may be some visual inconsistencies.

## Getting Started

This project is built entirely with Flutter web. To start the application locally with Chrome you can run:
<br>
```flutter pub get``` for dependencies
<br>
```flutter run -d chrome``` to start the app

The app has also been deployed to Heroku through a private account - please contact @Ollie Porter on Topl Slack for details. You can follow the [URL here](http://grants.topl.co/) to see the live site.
